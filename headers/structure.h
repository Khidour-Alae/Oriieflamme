* It just represent a rectangle with two points :
* one point is the lowest left point
* one point is the highest right point
*

/**
* board2D is a complex structure. It represents the board,
* that is to say a 2D plane on which you can place cards 
* belonging to factions. The cards can only be placed on 
* integer coordinates (for example : (0,0), (3,2), (-1,-2)).
* 
* To do this, we make two 2D-arrays, one that store the cards
* and one that stores from which faction the card was placed.
* 
* The 2D-arrays are implemented as a 1D-array with the following
* transformation : 1DArray[sizeOfLine * y + x] <=> 2DArray[x][y]
* 
* To represent an infinite 2D plane, the arrays can be
* dynamically resized. For example, if the array covers the
* 2D plane for :
*   # -5 <= x <= 5
*   # -5 <= y <= 5
* and we need to place a card at (5,6), then the array will
* grow in order to cover enough of the 2D plane to place the card
*
* As the array could be covering unecessary parts of the 2D plane
* we are using a bounding box. For example :
* if the array is covering -50 <= x <= 50 and -50 <= y <= 50
* but there are cards only in -10 <= x <= 3 and -7 <= y <= 4
* then the bounding box is used to get this information
* This is usefull mostly for printing the board or iterating
* through the board.
